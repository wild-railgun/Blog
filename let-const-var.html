            <li>let and const were introduced in ES6 as new ways to declare variables.</li>
            <li>
                var has function scope - variables are accessible anywhere in the function. 
                let and const have block scope - variables exist only within the nearest set 
                of curly braces {}.
            </li>
            <li>
                var variables can be redeclared in the same scope, let and const variables 
                cannot.
            </li>
            <li>
                let variables can be reassigned, const variables cannot be reassigned (they 
                are a constant reference).
            </li>
            <li>
                var declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, let and const 
                declarations are not hoisted.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            let and const are new ways of declaring a variable. They were introduced in ES6.
        </p>

        <p>
            When a variable is declared using var in a function, it has function scope. In 
            other words, that variable is only accessible inside that function. However, 
            when a variable is declared using the var keyword inside curly braces {}, it is 
            not limited to the scope of these curly braces. It can only be accessed outside 
            of this block.
        </p>

        <code>
            <pre>
                let a = 10;
                
                if (a === 10) {
                    var varVariable = 55;
                }

                
                console.log(varVariable); // This will output the value of varVariable
            </pre>
        </code>
        
        <p>
            On the other hand, when we declare a variable using the let and const keyword, 
            they are only accessible inside that block of code, whether it is inside of a function, 
            an if statement block, or any other block. In other words, let and const have block scope.
        </p>

        <code>
            <pre>
                let a = 10;
                
                if (a === 10) {
                    let letVariable = 55; //
                }
                
                console.log(letVariable); // Uncaught ReferenceError: letVariable is not defined
            </pre>
        </code>

        <p>
            You might be wondering the difference between let and const keywords. The crucial 
            difference between the two is that variables declared with the let keyword can be 
            reassigned a value but that is not the case with the const keyword. A const variable 
            defines a constant reference to a value, they cannot be reassigned.
        </p>

        <p>
            Variable declared with let or const keyword cannot be redeclared within the same 
            scope but variable declared with the var keyword can be redeclared, this solves a 
            lot of errors and problems and therefore it is a good practice to use let and const 
            keyword instead of var. But variables declared by the let keyword can be reassigned 
            a value.
