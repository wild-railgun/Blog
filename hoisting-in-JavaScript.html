        <ul>
            <li>
                Hoisting refers to the behavior where variable and function declarations 
                are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
            </li>

            <li>
                Function declarations defined with the function keyword are hoisted to the 
                top of their enclosing scope. This allows functions to be used before they 
                are defined.
            </li>

            <li>
                Variable declarations with var are hoisted, but only the declaration, 
                not the assignment. So var variables will have a value of undefined 
                before assignment.
            </li>

            <li>
                let and const variable declarations are not hoisted. Using them before 
                declaration will result in a reference error.
            </li>

            <li>
                Function declarations and var variables being hoisted can lead to unexpected 
                behavior and bugs if you don't understand how it works.
            </li>

            <li>
                Hoisting is relied upon in most JavaScript code for functions to be used 
                before their definition. But usage of variables before declaration depends 
                on hoisting and is best avoided.
            </li>

            <li>
                Function declarations and var variables being hoisted can lead to unexpected 
                behavior and bugs if you don't understand how it works.
            </li>
        </ul>
